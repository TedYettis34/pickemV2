# NAT Instance Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the implementation of a cost-optimized NAT Instance to replace the NAT Gateway in your AWS infrastructure. The NAT Instance provides the same functionality as a NAT Gateway but at a significantly reduced cost, making it ideal for small to medium deployments (up to 50 users).

## Cost Analysis

### NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance Cost Comparison

| Component | NAT Gateway | NAT Instance (t3.nano) | NAT Instance (t3.micro) | Savings |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Monthly Cost | $45.00 | $3.70 | $7.39 | $41.30 - $37.61 |
| Annual Cost | $540.00 | $44.40 | $88.68 | $495.60 - $451.32 |
| Cost Reduction | - | 91.8% | 83.6% | - |

**Note**: Costs are for us-east-1 region and don't include data transfer charges.

### Recommended Instance Types

- **t3.nano**: Best for low-traffic environments (< 20 users)
- **t3.micro**: Suitable for moderate traffic (20-50 users)
- **t4g.nano/micro**: ARM-based alternatives with lower costs
- **t3.small**: For higher traffic or future scaling needs

## Architecture

### Components

1. **NAT Instance**: Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with NAT functionality
2. **Elastic IP**: Static public IP for consistent routing
3. **Security Groups**: Least-privilege access controls
4. **IAM Roles**: Permissions for monitoring and management
5. **Auto Scaling Group**: Optional auto-recovery mechanism
6. **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics
7. **SNS Alerts**: Notification system for issues

### Security Features

- Source/destination check disabled for NAT functionality
- Restrictive security groups (only necessary ports)
- IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Automatic security updates via yum-cron
- CloudWatch logging for audit trails
- Network ACLs for additional protection

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

1. **SSH Key Pair**: Create an EC2 key pair for instance access
```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name pickem-nat-instance --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > pickem-nat-instance.pem
chmod 400 pickem-nat-instance.pem
```

2. **Terraform Variables**: Update terraform.tfvars
```hcl
use_nat_instance = true
nat_instance_type = "t3.nano"
key_pair_name = "pickem-nat-instance"
enable_nat_auto_recovery = false
```

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Preparation (No Downtime)
1. Deploy NAT instance alongside existing NAT Gateway
2. Verify NAT instance is healthy and configured correctly
3. Test routing from a test instance in private subnet

#### Phase 2: Migration (Brief Downtime - ~2 minutes)
1. Update route tables to point to NAT instance
2. Monitor connectivity from private subnets
3. Verify outbound internet access works correctly

#### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Remove NAT Gateway and associated EIP
2. Update Terraform state to reflect changes
3. Monitor for 24-48 hours to ensure stability

### Step-by-Step Migration

```bash
# 1. Plan the deployment
terraform plan -var="use_nat_instance=true"

# 2. Apply NAT instance (keeps NAT Gateway)
terraform apply -var="use_nat_instance=true"

# 3. Test NAT instance connectivity
aws ssm start-session --target <nat-instance-id>

# 4. Update route tables (this causes brief downtime)
terraform apply -target=aws_route.private_nat_route

# 5. Remove NAT Gateway (cost savings start here)
terraform destroy -target=aws_nat_gateway.pickem_nat_gw
terraform destroy -target=aws_eip.nat_eip

# 6. Clean up Terraform state
terraform apply
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

The NAT instance includes automated health checks:

1. **IP Forwarding Check**: Ensures kernel forwarding is enabled
2. **IPTables Rules Check**: Verifies NAT rules are in place
3. **Internet Connectivity**: Tests outbound connectivity
4. **Metadata Service**: Confirms AWS API access

### CloudWatch Metrics

Monitored metrics include:
- CPU Utilization
- Network Bytes In/Out
- Network Packets In/Out
- Active Connections
- Memory Usage
- Disk Usage

### Alerting

SNS topic configured for:
- High CPU usage (>80%)
- Instance status check failures
- Custom NAT health check failures

### Logging

CloudWatch Logs capture:
- System messages (/var/log/messages)
- NAT setup logs
- Health check results
- Performance metrics

## Operations Guide

### Accessing the NAT Instance

```bash
# Using SSM Session Manager (recommended)
aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>

# Using SSH (if security group allows)
ssh -i pickem-nat-instance.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
```

### Common Maintenance Tasks

#### Check NAT Status
```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/nat-health-check.sh
```

#### View IPTables Rules
```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -L -v
sudo iptables -L -v
```

#### Monitor Network Traffic
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n
sudo netstat -rn  # Check routing table
```

#### Check Performance
```bash
htop  # CPU and memory usage
iostat 1  # Disk I/O
iftop  # Network usage (if installed)
```

#### Restart NAT Services
```bash
sudo systemctl restart iptables
sudo sysctl -p  # Reload sysctl settings
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **No Internet Access from Private Subnets**
   - Check route table configuration
   - Verify source/destination check is disabled
   - Confirm IPTables NAT rules are present
   - Check security group rules

2. **High CPU Usage**
   - Monitor traffic patterns
   - Consider upgrading to t3.micro or t3.small
   - Check for unwanted connections

3. **Instance Unreachable**
   - Check instance status in EC2 console
   - Verify security group and NACLs
   - Use auto-recovery mechanism if configured

#### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check IP forwarding
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# View active connections
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l

# Check NAT rules
sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v

# Test outbound connectivity
curl -I http://www.google.com

# Check route table from private subnet
ip route show
```

## Security Considerations

### Hardening Recommendations

1. **Network Security**
   - Restrict SSH access to specific IP ranges
   - Use VPN or bastion host for management access
   - Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
   - Consider AWS WAF for additional protection

2. **Instance Security**
   - Regular security updates via yum-cron
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Use Systems Manager for patch management
   - Enable CloudTrail for API auditing

3. **Access Control**
   - Use IAM roles instead of access keys
   - Implement least-privilege principles
   - Regular access reviews and key rotation
   - MFA for administrative access

### Compliance

- SOC 2 Type II compliant configuration
- GDPR data protection considerations
- PCI DSS network segmentation support
- HIPAA security controls alignment

## High Availability Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Single instance in one AZ for cost optimization
- Auto Scaling Group for automatic recovery (optional)
- CloudWatch monitoring with SNS alerts

### Enhanced HA Options (Higher Cost)

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**
   - NAT instances in multiple AZs
   - Route table updates via Lambda
   - Health check failover

2. **Auto Scaling Group**
   - Automatic replacement of failed instances
   - Launch template for consistent configuration
   - Rolling updates for maintenance

## Performance Optimization

### Network Performance

- Instance types with enhanced networking
- SR-IOV for better packet processing
- Placement groups for low latency (if needed)

### Configuration Tuning

```bash
# Optimize network buffers
echo 'net.core.rmem_max = 16777216' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'net.core.wmem_max = 16777216' >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# Increase connection tracking
echo 'net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 65536' >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# TCP window scaling
echo 'net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Right-sizing**: Start with t3.nano and scale up if needed
2. **Reserved Instances**: 1-year term for additional savings
3. **Spot Instances**: Not recommended for NAT due to reliability needs
4. **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch to optimize instance size
5. **Automation**: Implement start/stop schedules for dev environments

## Backup and Recovery

### Configuration Backup
- AMI snapshots for quick recovery
- Terraform state backup to S3
- Configuration files in version control

### Recovery Procedures
1. Launch new instance from latest AMI
2. Update route tables to new instance
3. Verify connectivity and monitoring
4. Update DNS records if applicable
