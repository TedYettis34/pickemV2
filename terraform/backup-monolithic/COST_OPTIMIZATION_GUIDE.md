# PickEm Application Cost Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide provides specific recommendations for optimizing your PickEm application infrastructure costs for a 50-user deployment. The optimizations prioritize cost savings over performance and availability.

## Current Cost Analysis

### Current Infrastructure Monthly Costs (Estimated)
- **Aurora Serverless v2**: $43-$345 (dev) / $43-$1,380 (prod)
- **RDS Proxy**: $30-50
- **Dual NAT Gateways**: $90 + data transfer
- **Monitoring & Logging**: $20-40
- **Other AWS Services**: $20-30
- **Total Range**: $203-$535 (dev) / $203-$1,570 (prod)

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Database Optimization (Highest Impact)

#### Option A: Cost-Optimized RDS PostgreSQL (Recommended)
- **Change**: Replace Aurora Serverless v2 with standard RDS PostgreSQL
- **Instance**: db.t4g.micro (prod) / db.t3.micro (dev)
- **Configuration**: Single AZ, 20GB storage with auto-scaling to 100GB
- **Monthly Cost**: $12-15
- **Savings**: $31-$330 (dev) / $31-$1,365 (prod)

#### Option B: Ultra Cost-Optimized (Maximum Savings)
- **Instance**: db.t3.nano
- **Configuration**: Single AZ, no encryption, minimal backups
- **Monthly Cost**: $8-10
- **Savings**: $35-$335 (dev) / $35-$1,370 (prod)

#### Implementation Steps:
```bash
# 1. Create backup of current Aurora cluster
aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot --db-cluster-identifier your-cluster-id --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier pre-migration-backup

# 2. Set cost optimization variables
cp terraform.tfvars.cost-optimized terraform.tfvars

# 3. Plan migration
terraform plan -var="cost_optimized_mode=true"

# 4. Apply during maintenance window
terraform apply -var="cost_optimized_mode=true"
```

### 2. Networking Optimization

#### Option A: Single NAT Gateway (Recommended)
- **Change**: Use one NAT Gateway instead of two
- **Monthly Cost**: $45 + data transfer
- **Savings**: $45/month
- **Trade-off**: Single point of failure for internet access

#### Option B: NAT Instance (Maximum Savings)
- **Change**: Replace NAT Gateway with t3.nano EC2 instance
- **Monthly Cost**: $5-8 + data transfer
- **Savings**: $82-85/month
- **Trade-off**: Requires manual management and updates

### 3. Monitoring & Logging Optimization

#### Recommended Changes:
- Remove Performance Insights
- Disable Enhanced Monitoring
- Reduce CloudWatch log retention (3-7 days)
- Minimize CloudWatch alarms
- Remove VPC Flow Logs (ultra mode)

#### Savings: $17-37/month

## Cost Optimization Configurations

### Level 1: Cost-Optimized (Recommended for 50 users)
```hcl
cost_optimized_mode = true
ultra_cost_optimized_mode = false
```
- **Total Monthly Cost**: $60-68
- **Savings**: $143-$467 (dev) / $143-$1,502 (prod)
- **Suitable for**: Production workloads with acceptable performance trade-offs

### Level 2: Ultra Cost-Optimized (Budget-Conscious)
```hcl
cost_optimized_mode = true
ultra_cost_optimized_mode = true
```
- **Total Monthly Cost**: $14-21
- **Savings**: $189-$514 (dev) / $189-$1,549 (prod)
- **Suitable for**: Development/staging and very small production workloads

## Performance Trade-offs

### Database Performance
- **Impact**: 40-60% slower query performance during peak usage
- **Mitigation**: Optimize queries, add database indexes, consider read replicas if needed
- **Monitoring**: Set up basic CPU and connection monitoring

### Network Performance
- **Impact**: Potential bottleneck during high traffic (single NAT)
- **Mitigation**: Monitor network utilization, upgrade to NAT Gateway from NAT instance if needed
- **Availability**: Single point of failure for internet connectivity

### Monitoring Visibility
- **Impact**: Reduced insight into system performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement application-level monitoring, use AWS Personal Health Dashboard

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 days)
1. Review current usage patterns
2. Create full backup of Aurora cluster
3. Set up basic monitoring for new configuration
4. Update application connection strings

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Migration (Maintenance Window)
1. Apply Terraform changes during low-traffic period
2. Update DNS/connection strings
3. Verify application functionality
4. Monitor for 24-48 hours

### Phase 3: Optimization (1 week)
1. Monitor application performance
2. Optimize queries if needed
3. Adjust instance sizes if performance issues occur
4. Set up cost alerts for budget monitoring

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Essential Alerts to Keep:
- Database CPU > 90%
- Database connections > 80% of max
- Application error rates
- Basic infrastructure health

### Cost Monitoring:
```bash
# Set up AWS Budget alerts
aws budgets create-budget --account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --budget '{
  "BudgetName": "PickEm-Monthly-Budget",
  "BudgetLimit": {
    "Amount": "50",
    "Unit": "USD"
  },
  "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY",
  "BudgetType": "COST"
}'
```

## Scaling Considerations

### When to Upgrade (User Growth):
- **100+ users**: Upgrade to db.t4g.small
- **500+ users**: Consider db.t4g.medium + read replica
- **1000+ users**: Move back to Aurora Serverless v2 or db.r6g.large

### Performance Indicators:
- Database CPU consistently > 80%
- Query response times > 2 seconds
- Connection pool exhaustion
- User complaints about slow performance

## Alternative Database Options

### DynamoDB for Specific Use Cases
- **Best for**: Simple key-value operations, user sessions
- **Cost**: Pay-per-request model, very low for 50 users
- **Trade-off**: Limited query capabilities compared to PostgreSQL

### Amazon RDS Free Tier
- **Eligibility**: First 12 months of AWS account
- **Instance**: db.t3.micro (20GB storage)
- **Cost**: Free for 750 hours/month
- **Limitation**: 12-month limit, basic performance

## Cost Comparison Summary

| Configuration | Monthly Cost | Savings | Performance Impact |
|--------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Current Setup | $203-$1,570 | N/A | High Performance |
| Cost Optimized | $60-68 | $143-$1,502 | Moderate Performance |
| Ultra Optimized | $14-21 | $189-$1,549 | Basic Performance |

## Recommendations for 50 Users

1. **Use Cost-Optimized Mode**: Best balance of cost and performance
2. **Monitor Closely**: Set up basic monitoring and alerts
3. **Plan for Growth**: Have upgrade path ready when user base grows
4. **Regular Reviews**: Monthly cost reviews and quarterly performance assessments
5. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain regular backups despite cost optimizations

## Support and Rollback

### Rollback Plan:
If performance issues occur, you can quickly rollback:
```bash
# Rollback to previous configuration
terraform apply -var="cost_optimized_mode=false"
```

### Performance Troubleshooting:
1. Check database CPU and memory utilization
2. Analyze slow query logs
3. Monitor application response times
4. Consider temporary instance size increase during peak periods
