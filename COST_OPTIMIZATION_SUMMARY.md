# PickEm Application - Cost Optimization Summary for 50 Users

## Executive Summary

Your current PickEm application infrastructure is over-engineered for a 50-user deployment. By implementing the cost optimizations outlined below, you can reduce your monthly AWS costs by **$141-$440 per month** (85-87% savings) while maintaining acceptable performance for your user base.

## Current vs. Optimized Costs

| Configuration | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Savings |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Current Setup** | $203-$505 | $2,436-$6,060 | Baseline |
| **Cost Optimized** | $62-$65 | $744-$780 | $1,692-$5,280/year |
| **Ultra Optimized** | $16-$18 | $192-$216 | $2,244-$5,844/year |

## Specific Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Database: Replace Aurora Serverless v2 with Standard RDS PostgreSQL

**Current**: Aurora Serverless v2 (0.5-4 ACUs dev, 0.5-16 ACUs prod)
- **Cost**: $43-$345/month (dev), $43-$1,380/month (prod)

**Recommended**: RDS PostgreSQL db.t4g.micro (single AZ)
- **Cost**: $12-15/month
- **Savings**: $31-$330/month (dev), $31-$1,365/month (prod)
- **Configuration**:
  - Instance: db.t4g.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM)
  - Storage: 20GB GP3 with auto-scaling to 100GB
  - Single AZ deployment
  - 7-day backup retention (prod), 1-day (dev)

**Alternative Ultra-Budget**: db.t3.nano
- **Cost**: $8-10/month
- **Trade-offs**: Very limited performance, suitable only for light usage

### 2. Networking: Single NAT Gateway

**Current**: Dual NAT Gateways across 2 AZs
- **Cost**: $90/month + data transfer

**Recommended**: Single NAT Gateway
- **Cost**: $45/month + data transfer
- **Savings**: $45/month
- **Trade-off**: Single point of failure for internet access

**Alternative Ultra-Budget**: NAT Instance (t3.nano)
- **Cost**: $5-8/month + data transfer
- **Savings**: $82-85/month
- **Trade-offs**: Requires manual management and updates

### 3. Remove RDS Proxy

**Current**: RDS Proxy for connection pooling
- **Cost**: $30-50/month

**Recommended**: Direct database connections
- **Savings**: $30-50/month
- **Trade-off**: Application needs to manage connections directly
- **Mitigation**: Use connection pooling in your application (e.g., Node.js connection pools)

### 4. Simplified Monitoring

**Current**: Comprehensive monitoring with Performance Insights, Enhanced Monitoring, multiple alarms
- **Cost**: $20-40/month

**Recommended**: Basic CloudWatch monitoring
- **Cost**: $3-8/month
- **Savings**: $17-32/month
- **Changes**:
  - Remove Performance Insights
  - Remove Enhanced Monitoring
  - Keep only essential alarms (CPU > 90%, connections > 80%)
  - Reduce log retention to 3-7 days

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 days)
1. **Backup Current Setup**:
   ```bash
   aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot \
     --db-cluster-identifier your-cluster-id \
     --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier pre-migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Review Application Dependencies**:
   - Update connection strings to use new RDS endpoint
   - Implement connection pooling in application
   - Test application with reduced database capacity

3. **Set Up Basic Monitoring**:
   - Configure essential CloudWatch alarms
   - Set up AWS Budget alerts

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Migration (Maintenance Window)
1. **Apply Terraform Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Copy cost-optimized configuration
   cp terraform.tfvars.cost-optimized terraform.tfvars
   
   # Review planned changes
   terraform plan -var="cost_optimized_mode=true"
   
   # Apply during maintenance window
   terraform apply -var="cost_optimized_mode=true"
   ```

2. **Update Application Configuration**:
   - Update database connection strings
   - Remove RDS Proxy references
   - Deploy application updates

### Phase 3: Validation and Monitoring (1 week)
1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Load test with expected user patterns
   - Monitor database CPU and response times
   - Verify application functionality

2. **Cost Validation**:
   - Monitor AWS billing for first week
   - Verify expected cost reductions
   - Set up ongoing cost alerts

## Performance Expectations and Trade-offs

### Database Performance
- **Expected Impact**: 40-60% slower query performance during peak usage
- **Acceptable For**: 50 users with typical web application usage patterns
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Optimize database queries and add appropriate indexes
  - Implement application-level caching
  - Monitor and be ready to upgrade instance size if needed

### Network Performance
- **Impact**: Single point of failure for internet connectivity
- **Mitigation**: Monitor NAT Gateway/instance health closely
- **Acceptable Risk**: For 50 users, outage risk is manageable

### Monitoring Visibility
- **Impact**: Less detailed performance insights
- **Mitigation**: Implement application-level logging and monitoring
- **Essential Monitoring**: Keep CPU, memory, and connection monitoring

## Scaling Strategy

### User Growth Thresholds:
- **50-100 users**: Current cost-optimized setup should handle well
- **100-300 users**: Upgrade to db.t4g.small ($25-30/month)
- **300-500 users**: Consider db.t4g.medium + read replica
- **500+ users**: Evaluate return to Aurora Serverless v2 or larger RDS instances

### Performance Indicators for Scaling:
- Database CPU consistently > 80%
- Query response times > 2 seconds
- Connection pool exhaustion
- User-reported performance issues

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk:
- Cost optimization for 50-user deployment
- Gradual performance degradation vs. hard failure
- Easy rollback path available

### Medium Risk:
- Single NAT Gateway creates network dependency
- Reduced monitoring may delay issue detection

### Mitigation:
- Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- Monitoring of key performance metrics
- Clear rollback procedures documented

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**:
   - Review and approve cost optimization plan
   - Schedule maintenance window for migration
   - Set up AWS Budget alerts with $70/month limit

2. **Implementation (Next Week)**:
   - Execute migration plan during low-traffic period
   - Monitor application performance for 48 hours
   - Validate cost reductions in AWS billing

3. **Ongoing (Monthly)**:
   - Review AWS costs and usage patterns
   - Monitor application performance trends
   - Plan for scaling as user base grows

## Cost Tracking Commands

```bash
# Run cost estimation tool
./scripts/cost-estimation.sh

# Set up budget alert
aws budgets create-budget --account-id $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text) --budget file://budget.json

# Monitor current costs
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=2025-06-01,End=2025-06-30 --granularity MONTHLY --metrics BlittedCost
```

## Conclusion

For a 50-user PickEm application, the cost-optimized configuration provides the best balance of affordability and performance. The ultra-optimized configuration is suitable only if budget constraints are extreme. Both options provide substantial savings (85-95%) over your current setup while maintaining acceptable performance for your user base.

**Recommended Action**: Implement cost-optimized configuration with standard RDS PostgreSQL and single NAT Gateway for immediate $1,692-$5,280 annual savings.
